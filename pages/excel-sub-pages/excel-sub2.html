        <h1>Move Around and Make Selection in an Excel Worksheet</h1>
        <h2>BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR LEARNERS&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you already know how to create, save, close, and open a
          workbook it&rsquo;s time to learn how to move the active cell around
          the worksheet. Since there are more than 17 billion cells in a
          worksheet, Excel offers several ways to select the particular cell
          where you want to enter data, or the range of cells to be formatted.
          You can use the <strong>Arrow Keys</strong>, the
          <strong>Scroll Bars,&nbsp;</strong>or
          the<strong>&nbsp;Mouse&nbsp;</strong>select cellsto move quickly to
          different areas of the worksheet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Understanding Cells, Rows, and Columns</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong> </strong>A <strong>Cell</strong> is the basic building block
          of a worksheet where you enter information or content. Each rectangle
          in a worksheet which is formed by the intersection of a row and a
          column is called a cell. Cells are named by combining the column
          letter and row number where they are located
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A <strong>Row</strong> is a group of cells that runs from the left of
          the page to the right. They are identified by numbers, there are
          1,048,576 rows in a worksheet and the default row height is 15 points
          or 20 pixels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A <strong>Column</strong> is a group of cells that runs from the top
          of the page to the bottom. They are identified by letters, there are
          16,384 columns in a worksheet and the default column width is 8.43
          points or 64 pixels.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>To Move Around the Worksheet Using the Scroll Bar</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Scroll Bars</strong> allows you to scroll the worksheet up
          and down or side to side.

        <p><strong>To Move Using the Arrow Keys</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Up Arrow Key&nbsp;</strong>will move one cell above the
          selected cell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Right Arrow Key&nbsp;</strong>will move one cell to the right
          of the selected cell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Down Arrow Key&nbsp;</strong>will move one cell below the
          selected cell.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Left Arrow Key&nbsp;</strong>will move one cell to the left of
          the selected cell.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Ctrl + Home&nbsp;</strong>moves the selected cell to the very
          top left of the worksheet (cell A1)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ctrl + End&nbsp;</strong>moves the selected cell to the very
          bottom right of the worksheet (cell XFD1048576)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ctrl +Arrow Key&nbsp;</strong>moves the selected cell to the
          last cell in the group containing data
        </p>
        <p>(depending on the direction of the arrow)</p>

        <h3>SELECTING CELLS, ROWS AND COLUMNS</h3>
        <strong>Selecting Cell</strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is important to learn how to select a cell, column, row, range of
          cells, columns and rows, because by selecting a cell, you instruct
          Excel where to store the data that you enter into a worksheet. Before
          applying any of the formatting commands you have to select first the
          cell that you want to format, any formatting that you made in a
          worksheet will be applied in the selected cell only. The selected cell
          is surrounded by a green border, and its column letter and row number
          will be highlighted.
        </p>

        <p>
          1. Place the pointer over the first cell, hold the left mouse button
          and drag the mouse until all of the adjoining cells you want to select
          are highlighted.

          Using an arrow key, place the selected cell to the first cell in the
          range, hold down the <strong>Shift key</strong> and press an
          <strong>arrow</strong> <strong>key</strong> to select the range.
