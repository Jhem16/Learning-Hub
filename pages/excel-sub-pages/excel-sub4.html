        <h3>Background Information for Learners</h3>
        <p>
          Cut, Copy and Paste are very essential operations in Excel. You can
          quickly copy and/or cut information in cells like texts, numbers or
          formulas, and paste them into another cells. These operations save you
          a lot of time from having to type and retype the same information. The
          Cut, Copy and Paste buttons are located on the Ribbon.
        </p>

        <h3>Copy and Paste Cell Contents</h3>
        <p>
          The Copy Feature allows you to copy selected information from the
          spreadsheet and temporarily place it on the clipboard, which is a
          temporary storage file in your computer&rsquo;s memory. The Paste
          feature allows you to select any of the collected items on the
          clipboard and Paste it in a cell of the same or different spreadsheet.
        </p>

      </div>

      <h3>To copy data in a cell:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a cell or cells to Be duplicated.</li>
        <li>Click on the Copy button on the Ribbon.</li>
        <li>The boarder of the copied</li>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>Cell(s) takes on the Appearance of marching ants</p>
        <li>Click on the cell where you want</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To place the duplicated information.</p>
      <p>
        The cell will be highlighted if you are copying contents from more than
        one cell. Click the first cell where you want to place the duplicated
        information.
      </p>
      <ol start="5">
        <li>
          Click the location or cell where you want the duplicated information
          to be pasted. Click the Paste button on the Ribbon or press the Enter
          Key on your keyboard.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <img src="/assets/img/excel/Picture4-3.png" alt="" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Note: Be careful if you paste copied cell information into cells that
        already contain data. If you do, the existing data is overwritten.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        You can copy information from many different sources including Websites,
        emails, or other Office Applications like Word and PowerPoint and paste
        it into an Excel Spreadsheet.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Cut and Paste Cell Contents</h3>
      <p>
        The Cut feature allows you to remove information from cells in the
        spreadsheet. Information that is cut can be pasted in another cell, as
        long as the pasting occurs before you perform another operation. If you
        don&rsquo;t paste the cut information immediately, it is removed from
        the Office Clipboard.
      </p>

      <h3>Moving Information using Drag &ndash; and &ndash; Drop</h3>
      <p>
        Alternative way to move data from one cell to another is to use the
        drag-and-drop process. You use the pointer to point to the data to be
        relocated and then drag the cell to its new location.
      </p>
      <h3>To use Drag &ndash; and &ndash; Drop</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Highlight and select the cell(s) you want to move to a new location.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the mouse pointer near one of the outside ends of the selected
          cell(s). The mouse pointer changes from a large, white cross and
          become a slim, black cross with arrows at all ends.
        </li>

        <li>
          Keep the mouse pointer on the outer edge of the selected cell, click
          and hold the left mouse button and drag the cell(s) to a new location.
        </li>
        <figure>
          <img src="/assets/img/excel/Picture7-3.png" alt="" />
        </figure>
        <li>
          Release the mouse button to move the information to the new location.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Deleting Information in a Cell</h3>
      <h3>To delete data that already appears in a cell:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the cell that contains the information to be deleted.</li>
        <li>Press the Delete Key or</li>
        <li>
          Right &ndash; Click and choose Clear Contents from the shortcut menu.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>To delete Data Being Typed But Not Yet Added to the Cell</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Stop an entry by pressing the Escape(esc) key on your keyboard or
          Simply press the Backspace key also found in the keyboard
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Undo and Redo</strong></p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, you might do something to a spreadsheet that you didn&rsquo;t
        mean to do, like typing the wrong numbers or texts in a cell. MS Excel
        allows you to undo an operation by simply clicking the Undo Button found
        on the Quick Access Toolbar.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/assets/img/excel/Picture8-3.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        <strong
          >To Undo Recent Actions (Typing, Formatting, Etc, one at a
          time)</strong
        >
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the Undo Button. <img src="/assets/img/excel/Picture9-3.jpg" alt="" /></li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>To undo several recent actions at once</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the arrow next to the Undo Button</li>
        <li>Select the desired undo operation(s) from the list.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Microsoft Excel reverses the selected action and all actions that appear
        in the list above it.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Undo operation can be cancelled by applying a Redo. This is useful
        when an Undo operation was mistakenly applied. Remember, a Redo is
        possible only if you have not changed an Excel spreadsheet since the
        last Undo operation was completed.
      </p>
      <p><strong>To Redo an Undo Operation</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the <img src="/assets/img/excel/Picture10-3.jpg" alt="" /></li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>To Redo several recent Undo actions at once</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the arrow next to Redo button.</li>
        <li>Select the desired Redo operations from the list.</li>
        <li>Microsoft Excel reverses the Undo Operation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Shortcut Keys for Cut, Copy and Paste, Undo and Redo</strong>
